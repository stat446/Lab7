# Lab7

## Lab Overview

For this lab we will use a candy dataset collected by [www.fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/). Additional details about the dataset are available below (courtesy of Kaggle).

```{r, message = F}
candy <- read_csv('http://math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat446/candy-data.csv')
candy
```

### Context

Whatâ€™s the best (or at least the most popular) Halloween candy? That was the question this dataset was collected to answer. Data was collected by creating a website where participants were shown presenting two fun-sized candies and asked to click on the one they would prefer to receive. In total, more than 269 thousand votes were collected from 8,371 different IP addresses.

### Content

`candy-data.csv` includes attributes for each candy along with its ranking. For binary variables, 1 means yes, 0 means no. The data contains the following fields:

- chocolate: Does it contain chocolate?
- fruity: Is it fruit flavored?
- caramel: Is there caramel in the candy?
- peanutalmondy: Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?
- nougat: Does it contain nougat?
- crispedricewafer: Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?
- hard: Is it a hard candy?
- bar: Is it a candy bar?
- pluribus: Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?
- sugarpercent: The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.
- pricepercent: The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set.
- winpercent: The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups.

### Questions
Assume we are interested in understanding the `winpercentage` for four groups of candies:

1. chocolate and pluribus
2. chocolate and not pluribus
3. no chocolate and pluribus
4. no chocolate and not pluribus

#### 1. (5 points)
Compare and contrast stratified sampling with domain estimation. How are they similar and how are they different.



#### 2. (5 points)
A stratified sample with ten samples from each strata has been taken for you. Compute the point estimates for mean  `winpercentage` for each strata.

```{r}
stratified_sample <- candy %>% group_by(chocolate, pluribus) %>% sample_n(10) %>% ungroup() 
```


#### 3. (5 points)
An SRS sample of size 40 is also taken. Compute the point estimates for mean `winpercentage` within each strata.

```{r}
srs_sample <- candy %>% sample_n(40)
```

#### 4. (5 points)
Compute the variance of the mean `winpercentage` for each domain. You can assume that N and N_d are known.
